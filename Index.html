  <section id="about">
    <p>
      For the past several years, I’ve been given the grace to create art,
      music, and poetry as a means of healing and building community.
      Inspired by 9th Wonder, Big K.R.I.T., Erick the Architect, J Dilla,
      and many others.
    </p>

    <p>
      The goal is simple: to heal, to connect, to create, and to honor the
      culture that made space for this work to exist.
      Join me, and let’s build something magical through sound.
